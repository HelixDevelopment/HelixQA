// HXC-278 — the THIRD failure route out of extractLoginToken, and the
// one nobody asked about.
//
// The same function fails three distinct ways, and each was closed
// separately because each leaks a different thing:
//
//	200 + undecodable body        → body echoed.  Closed by HXC-267.
//	non-200, or decode error      → body echoed.  Closed by HXC-270.
//	200 + decodable + no token    → KEYS echoed.  This item.
//
// The surviving route renders sortedKeys(decoded) — the reply's field
// NAMES — %q-quoted and UNBOUNDED in both count and per-key length.
//
// WHY "KEYS ONLY, NEVER VALUES" IS NOT SUFFICIENT HERE. The rationale
// HXC-239 shipped with sortedKeys is usually sound: a field name
// describes data rather than carrying it. Two things undermine it on
// exactly this route:
//
//  1. The keys come from WHATEVER SERVER ACTUALLY ANSWERED. A request
//     landing on the wrong system, or a service rendering diagnostic
//     material under unusual names, puts that material into a durable
//     record. A 200 that decodes but carries no recognisable token is
//     PRECISELY the wrong-service signature — it is the one route
//     where "some other system replied" is the leading hypothesis, so
//     it is the worst possible place to trust the peer's naming.
//  2. The list had NO BOUND AT ALL — not on key count, not on
//     individual key length — sitting beside undecodableBodyContentTypeMax,
//     a bound this same area already applies to a different piece of
//     server-controlled reply data for exactly this concern.
//
// A JSON object may be keyed by anything, including the credential
// itself: `{"<jwt>": {...}}` is a perfectly ordinary map-keyed-by-token
// shape, and its key IS the token.
//
// MEASURED SITE COUNT — FOUR sinks fed by ONE render site, not the
// three the review named. The review named the returned error, the
// finding Description and the session stdout line. Measured by
// following the render site's error value to every terminal sink:
//
// Line numbers below are POST-FIX (this tree). They are a reading
// aid, not the contract — the contract is the assertions.
//
//	render  http_executor.go:554-555  the %q of the key census
//	  ├─ propagates: loginWithRetry:919 → login:827 → applyAuth:418

//	       └─ SINK 4  pipeline.go:3330       finding Description
//
// http_executor.go:315 also receives the error and is NOT a sink: the
// 401-retry path guards on `err == nil` and discards it.
//
// SINK 2 is on the path but is not SERIALLY reachable, and this file
// says so rather than shipping a case that would pass vacuously:
// within one Execute call, applyAuth at :246 runs BEFORE ensureCSRF at
// :258 and returns early on error, so a login that fails here never
// reaches the CSRF preflight on that goroutine.
//
// "Serially" is the precise word, and the round-1 review was right to
// ask for it. The executor guards its shared state with h.mu and
// documents LastResponse as safe for concurrent use, so two Execute
// calls may be in flight at once, and then the sink IS reachable —
// traced, not assumed (§11.4.6):
//
//	applyAuth caches the bearer under the trimmed AuthMode
//	  (resolveCreds sets credsKey = mode), so goroutine A can satisfy
//	  :246 from cache without logging in at all;
//	goroutine B takes a 401 and calls invalidateCachedToken at :291,
//	  which deletes that same key under h.mu;
//	goroutine A then reaches :258, and ensureCSRF's own applyAuth now
//	  misses the cache and logs in for real — landing on this error.
//
// So SINK 2 is unreachable only in the single-goroutine shape a
// deterministic test would drive (§11.4.50), not in principle.
//
// No assertion gap follows, and the reason is compositional rather
// than incidental: SINK 2 does not render the census itself. ensureCSRF
// wraps applyAuth's error with %w ("preflight auth: %w") and Execute
// renders that wrapper at :259 — so it carries the SAME error value
// SINK 1 renders. Whatever bytes reach one reach the other, and pinning
// the wrapped value pins both. The login-error case below is that pin.
//
// NOT a sink, and deliberately left alone: the `tried` list rendered
// beside the census in the same error. It comes from TokenField /
// TokenFieldFallbacks — operator configuration, not the reply — so it
// is not reply-derived name material and is outside this item.
//
// Session stdout is a durable sink: it is captured, archived and
// attached to reports, which is why this guard asserts on it and not
// only on findings.
//
// §11.4.115 polarity, same deviation and rationale documented on
// redModeOn: the STANDING default is GREEN (defect-absent) so

		// neither of the other two rules can, each for a different
		// reason:
		//
		//	all-digit: no letter of either case, so
		//	  isSingleCaseDigitRun's "digit && lower != upper" is
		//	  false (lower and upper are both false, so they are
		//	  equal), and charClassCount counts one class.
		//	all-hex-letter, one case: no digit at all, so
		//	  isSingleCaseDigitRun declines regardless of case, and
		//	  charClassCount again counts one class.
		//	all-hex-letter, mixed case: still no digit, so
		//	  isSingleCaseDigitRun declines the same way, and
		//	  charClassCount now counts TWO classes — lower and
		//	  upper — still short of its three-class floor.
		//
		// None decodes to readable text in the convention the named
		// markers above follow: a digit-only alphabet cannot encode
		// a letter, and an alphabet confined to hex letters (a-f /
		// A-F) can only decode to byte values 0xAA-0xFF — outside
		// printable ASCII — so these are clearly-labelled synthetic
		// digit/letter constants rather than decode-and-read
		// fixtures. Each is exactly credentialShapedKeyMinLen bytes.

		// run instead of being cut into three sub-threshold pieces —
		// but nothing above pinned that purpose: every JWT-shaped
		// fixture in this file (hxc278JWTKeyMarker, helixCodeJWT,
		// hxc278EmbeddedKeyMarker) carries the 36-byte first segment
		// "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9", which the
		// three-class rule (charClassCount(run) >= 3) catches ON THAT
		// SEGMENT ALONE even with the dot removed from
		// isCredentialRunByte — so deleting the merge left the whole
		// suite green.
		//
		// A compact JWT whose EVERY segment is under
		// credentialShapedKeyMinLen is the shape only the merge
		// protects — entirely realistic, e.g. an alg-none-family
		// token. With the dot merging the three segments into one
		// 40-byte run, the JWT rule (len(segments) >= 3, each segment
		// isCredentialAlphabet) matches and the whole run is masked.
		// Delete `|| c == '.'` and the run instead splits at each dot
		// into three runs of 19, 8 and 11 bytes — every one below the
		// credentialShapedKeyMinLen floor — so runIsCredentialShaped
		// returns false for all three and looksCredentialShaped
		// returns false for the whole key: a verbatim leak of a real
