// declines are the STEADY STATE of this corpus, not an exception —
// a healthy `list --banks banks/` prints 50 of these lines on every

// twin pair. There is a real argument that a steady-state 50-line
// list trains operators to ignore the very channel this item exists
// to create, and that the healthy case should summarise ("50
// declined, use --verbose") while the full list is reserved for the
// abort path where it is diagnostic. That change is NOT made here,
// and round 18 corrected the reason given. This block used to cite
// §11.4.122, arguing a summary would REDUCE what an operator
// currently sees. It would not: at 0634b1b8 there is no declined
// surface at all — twinLogger, LoadDirVerbose, DeclinedFile and
// LoadDirResult have ZERO occurrences at HEAD, so `list` prints ZERO
// declined lines and this change CREATES the 50-line surface rather
// than preserving it. §11.4.122 governs removing already-shipped
// capability and has no purchase on the shape of a surface being
// introduced. The reason to ship the full list is the guarantee
// itself: HXC-305's operative statement is that a scan must never
// discard a file without saying so, and a count-only summary reports
// how many files were dropped but never WHICH — so it would not
// discharge that statement as written. The 50 lines ARE the fix.
// The trade-off above is real, but orthogonal to the silent-loss
// defect this change fixes — the harm measured in rounds 14 and 16
// was always on the ABORT path, where the list went to ZERO.
// Summarising the healthy path would need its own RED baseline, its
// own guard and its own evidence. Raised here so the trade-off is

// LoadDirVerbose loads all test bank files from a directory (as

//
// A bank commonly ships as a YAML/JSON twin pair sharing one base
// name: a legacy prose YAML (steps described in English the executor
// cannot run) and a JSON form produced by a prose-to-http conversion
// pass (steps carrying an explicit `http:`/`adb_shell:`/... action the
// executor CAN run). WHICH twin's content is preferred for a case
// shared by both is decided by CONTENT, not by format, and — HXC-305
// finding F1 — PER CASE, not per bank: for each shared case id the
// side whose OWN body has STRICTLY MORE genuinely-executable steps
// (ParseAction() != ActionTypeDescription) wins that case; ties keep
// the primary's body. A whole-bank comparison is NOT sound for this,
// because a conversion pass can improve a bank overall while making
// an individual case WORSE — de-converting an already-executable step
// back into prose. That is not hypothetical: in this project's corpus
// atmosphere.json wins the bank-level comparison (49/395 executable
// steps vs the YAML twin's 24/566) yet carries a strictly worse body
// for PA-001, PA-005 and VR-015, each of which has one executable
// `adb_shell:` step in the YAML twin and none in the JSON twin. Under
// a bank-granularity preference those three cases stop executing —
// the HXC-305 defect class (a silently-preferred twin hiding
// executable steps) reintroduced in the opposite direction. Per-case
// preference keeps all 41 cases the JSON twin genuinely improves IN
// THAT BANK (684 across the whole corpus, of 1897 shared ids) AND
// those 3 it would have demoted. The 684 figure is corpus-wide and
// an earlier revision of this comment attached it to atmosphere
// alone, which is off by 16x.
//
// The bank-level comparison still runs, but ONLY to choose the
// "primary" — the twin whose case ORDER and whose bank-level
// Name/Version/Metadata the merged result carries, and whose body
// wins a per-case tie. (That attribution is cosmetic downstream:
// Manager keys cases by case ID, not by bank identity.)
//
// The preferred twin is NOT assumed to be a full superset of the
// other's case ids — a prose-to-http conversion pass can convert only
// SOME of a bank's cases, leaving the rest behind as unconverted
// prose that exists ONLY in the other twin (HXC-305 finding B1: one
// real bank in this project's corpus converts 129 of its YAML twin's
// 179 cases; the JSON form wins on executable-step count, but the
// other 50 case ids exist only in the YAML form and MUST NOT vanish
// just because the comparison picked JSON). So the twins are MERGED:
// the primary's cases are kept in order (each body resolved per-case
// as above), and any case id present in the OTHER twin but absent
// from the primary is appended, sourced from that other twin. The
// resulting case-id set is always the UNION of both twins', never a
// subset of either — the executable-step comparison decides which
// VERSION of a case shared by both twins is kept, never whether a
// case exists at all.
//
// PARSE FAILURES are deliberately asymmetric, preserving exactly the
// guarantee each form has always carried: the non-JSON twin has
// always been REQUIRED to parse, so if it fails, the whole directory
// scan still hard-fails. A JSON twin, by contrast, was historically
// never parsed at all when a non-JSON sibling existed, so a JSON
// parse failure does NOT newly hard-fail a directory that always
// loaded before; the non-JSON twin loads (the pre-existing source of
// truth) and the failure is reported in Declined rather than
// swallowed.
//
// That asymmetry is a SYNTACTIC guarantee and nothing more, and it
// must not be over-read (HXC-305 F2, round-4 correction). An earlier
// revision of this comment justified the hard-fail as preventing "a
// corrupt/truncated YAML bank resolving quietly to its JSON
// sibling". It does not, and cannot: the branch fires only on input
// that is not valid YAML, which is a shape truncation essentially
// never produces. YAML block sequences are self-terminating, so
// cutting a bank file short at a case boundary leaves a perfectly
// valid document that simply declares fewer cases, and an empty file
// parses to a valid zero-case bank. Measured on this corpus against
// the real binary: truncating banks/atmosphere.yaml at a case
// boundary exits 0 and drops the catalog 3046 -> 3006 cases with no
// error and no mention; emptying it exits 0 and drops it to 2996,
// losing exactly the 50 ids unique to that twin, while the decline
// line it prints positively asserts "none lost". Only a mid-token
// corruption trips the parse check — and then it aborts the whole
// 195-file scan, 3046 -> 0. JSON does not share the property (it is
// bracket-delimited, so truncation is always a parse error), which is
// why the check looks effective when exercised against JSON and is
// inert on the form that actually relies on it.
//
// The reachable class is therefore closed by CONTENT invariants
// rather than by the parse check:
//
//   - ZERO-CASE (always on, no configuration). A file that parses but
//     declares no test cases at all is never a legitimate bank in
//     this corpus (measured: 0 of 195 files). For the non-JSON twin
//     of a pair it is the exact corruption shape the parse check
//     misses, so it hard-fails the scan — the guarantee the old
//     comment claimed, now actually delivered. Everywhere else (a
//     zero-case JSON twin, a standalone file, a stray non-bank YAML
//     that happens to sit in the directory) it is REPORTED in
//     Declined instead, so it can never again be indistinguishable
//     from a file that was never read, without newly hard-failing a
//     directory that has always loaded.
//
//   - ID FLOOR (opt-in per directory). Zero-case cannot catch a
//     PARTIAL truncation, which still declares plenty of cases. That
//     needs an expected id set, and the only non-brittle source for
//     one is a record of what the directory is known to hold. A
//     directory MAY therefore carry a bankIDFloorFile listing the
//     case ids it is expected to yield; every id in it must end up
//     either loaded or explicitly excluded, and a missing one is a
//     hard error naming it. It is a FLOOR, not an equality check, so
//     adding cases — the common edit — never trips it and never
//     needs a regeneration; only REMOVING a case does, which is the
//     event that should be visible in review rather than silent. A
//     directory without the file is not floor-checked at all, so an
//     arbitrary --banks path keeps loading exactly as before.
//
// A twin pair's (possibly merged) case ids can also genuinely collide
// with an UNRELATED bank elsewhere in the directory — a real,
// separate content-authoring defect, not a twin relationship
// (HXC-305 finding B3). That must not abort the entire directory
// scan: the colliding case id(s) are excluded from the twin's loaded
// bank and reported by name, while every other case in the pair — and
// every other bank in the directory — still loads. This differs from
// the cross-bank duplicate-id check for a genuinely standalone
// (non-twin) file below, which still hard-fails the whole scan, since
// a lone duplicate id between two otherwise-unrelated files has no
// merge or partial-exclusion available to it.
//
// Every declined file (twin loser, or one that failed to parse) is
// always reported in Declined, together with exactly what happened to
// its content: merged in verbatim, excluded for colliding elsewhere,
// or neither (every one of its ids was already present in the twin
// that was kept).
//
// "Always" includes an ERROR return: the result is non-nil and its
// Declined list is complete as of the abort on every failure path
// that could have declined anything. Banks, by contrast, is only the
// directory's catalog when err is nil — on an error return it holds
// just what loaded before the abort.

	// before the tests run. Labelling it a completeness check was an
	// invitation to trust it in the table's place.
	//
	// Match the RETURN SHAPE, never a variable name, and keep the
	// pattern anchored. Round 16 found the eighth discarding abort
	// (`return nil, nonJSONErr`, the unparseable non-JSON twin) still
	// live because the check prescribed here USED to read
	// "return nil, err": it named a variable, so it was structurally
	// incapable of seeing a site whose error happened to be called
	// something else, and it reported a clean zero while the defect it
	// existed to catch sat 183 lines below it. The anchor matters for

	// HXC-305 round 6 fixed exactly one abort (the id-floor failure)
	// to carry the list and left the rest returning a bare nil. Round
	// 14 measured what that cost on a fixture with a declined twin AND

	// while the same fixture minus the duplicate printed one. The
	// operator saw "duplicate test case id" and nothing about which
	// twin had already been dropped or what content went with it —
	// the precise silent loss this item exists to eliminate — HXC-305's
	// operative statement is that a directory scan must never discard a
	// file without saying so, and a discarded declined list is exactly
	// that. (The standard is the ITEM's, deliberately: LoadDirVerbose's
	// own doc comment promises the same thing, but that comment was
	// written in this very change, so citing it as the authority the
	// code violates would be circular — the doc cannot constrain the
	// code it shipped with.) Round 16
	// measured the identical loss on the twin-parse-failure path,
	// against the real banks/ corpus: corrupting one bank took `list`
	// from 50 declined lines to 0. With this fix the same corruption
	// keeps 49 — every decline except the corrupted pair's own, which
	// now aborts before it can be declined. (Lines, not bytes: each
	// line embeds the bank's full path, so the byte volume of the same
	// 50 declines ranges from ~14 KB to ~42 KB purely with the length

//
// Three properties keep this from being brittle against legitimate
// bank edits:
//
//   - It is a FLOOR, never an equality check. Adding cases — by far
//     the common edit — can never trip it and never requires the file
//     to be regenerated. Only REMOVING a case does, and a removal is
//     precisely the event that should surface in review rather than
//     land silently (§11.4.122).
//   - It is OPT-IN per directory. A directory with no floor file is
//     not checked at all, so `--banks <any path>` keeps behaving
//     exactly as it did; nothing new can fail for a caller pointing
//     at an arbitrary directory.
//   - It is regenerable from the corpus itself by a dedicated
//     command — `helixqa banks regen-floor` / RegenerateBankIDFloor
//     (see bankIDFloorFile) — so it can never drift into a hand-
//     maintained second source of truth (§11.4.77). That command
//     bypasses THIS check by construction, because a regeneration is
//     only ever run while this check is failing.
//
// A malformed or unreadable floor file is itself an error rather than
// a silent skip: a floor that quietly stops being enforced is the
// same class of defect it exists to catch.
//
// HONEST BOUNDARY (§11.4.6). banks/'s floor currently records exactly
// the ids the catalog currently yields (3046 == 3046), so today it
// happens to be indistinguishable from a snapshot. That equality is
// incidental — nothing has been added since it was written — but the
// coverage consequence is real and is NOT a bug being papered over: a
// bank added AFTER a regeneration is outside the floor's protection
// until the next regeneration, so truncating that new bank is not
// caught by this mechanism. Making it an equality check instead would
// close that gap only by making every ADD fail the scan until the
// floor was rewritten, which trades a silent-loss guard for a
// constant tax on the common edit. The chosen posture is therefore
// deliberate: a monotone lower bound, plus a cheap and loud
// regeneration (`helixqa banks regen-floor`) that a change adding
// banks is expected to run. Zero-case detection, which IS
// unconditional, still covers a newly-added bank truncated all the
// way to empty; only PARTIAL truncation of a post-floor bank is

//
//   - The scan runs with the floor check OFF by construction

//     suppress the catalog this function reads. Every other error —
//     unparseable bank, duplicate id, unreadable directory — still
//     aborts and no file is written.
//   - An empty id set is refused outright. Writing a floor that
//     protects nothing is never a legitimate outcome, and it is the
//     precise shape the old pipeline produced.
//   - The write is atomic (temp file + rename in the same
//     directory), so an interrupted regeneration leaves the previous
//     floor intact rather than a truncated one.
//
// The recorded set is every id that satisfies the floor: loaded, OR
// reported as an excluded cross-bank duplicate. That mirrors
// checkBankIDFloor's own accounting exactly, which is the point: the two
// sides of the guard agree by construction rather than by coincidence.
//
// It does NOT currently change the result. In any successfully-returned
// LoadDirResult `excluded` is a subset of the loaded ids, so the
// loaded-only view the old `helixqa list` pipeline had yields an
// identical set — it would drop a legitimately excluded id on ZERO
// regenerations, not on every one. The union is kept because that subset
