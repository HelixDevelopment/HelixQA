# Open-Source Tools

HelixQA integrates 22 open-source tools as git submodules under `tools/opensource/`. Each tool addresses a specific aspect of QA automation — device recording, vision-driven interaction, memory leak detection, test reporting, and more.

git submodule update --init --recursive tools/opensource/
```

## Key Tools in Detail

### scrcpy — Android Recording

scrcpy provides high-quality Android screen recording and mirroring without root access. HelixQA uses it as the preferred recording method for all Android SDK versions:

```bash
# Record to file, no display window
scrcpy --record qa-session.mp4 --no-display

# With bitrate control
scrcpy --record qa-session.mp4 --no-display --video-bit-rate 4M
```

scrcpy handles all SDK versions uniformly, unlike `adb shell screenrecord` which fails on Android 15 (SDK 35).

### docker-android — Containerised Emulators

docker-android runs Android emulators inside containers without requiring KVM or hardware virtualisation on the host:

```bash
podman run --privileged \
  -e DEVICE="Samsung Galaxy S10" \
  -p 5554:5554 \
  -p 5555:5555 \
  docker.io/budtmo/docker-android:emulator_14.0
```

After the emulator boots, connect via ADB:

```bash
adb connect localhost:5555
export HELIX_ANDROID_DEVICE="localhost:5555"
```

See [Containerization](/advanced/containers) for a full compose example with HelixQA and docker-android together.

### redroid — Android in Container

redroid provides a lighter-weight alternative to docker-android for Android-in-container scenarios, suitable for CI environments:

```bash
podman run -itd --rm --privileged \
  -p 5555:5555 \
  docker.io/redroid/redroid:13.0.0-latest
```

### leakcanary — Memory Leak Detection

leakcanary detects memory leaks in Android apps at runtime. HelixQA's performance monitoring integrates with leakcanary reports to correlate heap growth with specific UI actions.

Add leakcanary to your Android app's debug build:

```kotlin
// app/build.gradle.kts
debugImplementation("com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android:2.14")
```

HelixQA reads leakcanary output from logcat and incorporates it into the performance findings.

### moondream — Lightweight Vision Analysis

moondream is a small vision model that can run locally on CPU. It is used as a fallback when no cloud vision provider is configured, or as a cost-effective supplement for screenshot pre-screening:

```bash
# Run moondream locally via Ollama
ollama pull moondream
export HELIX_OLLAMA_URL="http://localhost:11434"
```

### ui-tars — GUI-Specialised Vision

ui-tars is a vision model specifically trained on GUI screenshots, providing more accurate analysis of UI elements than general-purpose vision models. Used when available for the screenshot analysis phase.

### allure2 — Test Reports

allure2 generates rich interactive HTML test reports. HelixQA can export results in allure format:

```bash
helixqa report \
  --input qa-results/session-* \
  --format allure

# Open the report
allure serve qa-results/allure-results/
```

### perfetto — Android System Tracing

perfetto captures detailed system-level performance traces on Android, including CPU scheduling, memory allocation, and I/O activity. HelixQA triggers perfetto traces around performance-sensitive test steps:

```bash
adb shell perfetto \
  -c - --txt \
  -o /data/misc/perfetto-traces/trace.perfetto-trace
```

### signoz — APM Integration

signoz provides open-source application performance monitoring. Connect HelixQA sessions to your signoz instance to correlate QA test execution with backend service metrics:

```bash
export HELIX_SIGNOZ_URL="http://localhost:3301"
```

## Adding Custom Tools

To integrate an additional open-source tool:

1. Add it as a git submodule under `tools/opensource/`
2. Implement the relevant interface in `pkg/navigator/` (for executors) or `pkg/analysis/` (for analysis tools)
3. Wire it into the executor factory in `pkg/autonomous/`
